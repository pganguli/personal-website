I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, advised by [Samarjit Chakraborty](https://cs.unc.edu/~samarjit). My research interests include cyber physical systems and formal methods.

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Calcutta, while simultaneously completing a bachelor's degree in Data Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
I also worked under [Ansuman Banerjee](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ansuman) as an undergrad research intern in the Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
