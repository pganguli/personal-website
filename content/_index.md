# About Me

My name is Prateek Ganguli and Iâ€™m a programmer. I'm currently pursuing a BTech Degree in Computer Science from Calcutta University, along with a BS Degree in Data Science from Indian Institue of Technology, Madras. The vast majority of my free time is spent studying and working on side projects.
